  <h2>COMPONENT</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>a board</li>
    <li>a dice</li>
    <li>tokens for each player</li>
    <li>25 yellow cards = easy</li>
    <li>25 blue cards = difficult</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>SETUP</h2>
  <p>
    Place the board on a table Place the two different types of questions on their allotted space on
    the board. Each player chooses one token to represent them while traveling around the board
  </p>
  <h2>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h2>
  <p>
    Each player throws the dice. The player with the highest total starts the play. Then each player
    places his token on the corner marked "GO", and throws the dice and moves the number of spaces
    indicated by the dice. You answer a question, there are two difficulty levels. Everytime you
    have the right answer, you gain a person and keep the card. If you donâ€™t have the right answer,
    you put the card back in the game. The tokens remain on the spaces occupied and proceed from
    that point on the player's next turn. Two or more tokens may rest on the same space at the same
    time. Be careful, some squares on the board make you lose a card, win a card, be arrested by the
    police...
  </p>
  <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>

    The "police" square: If you come across this square, you pass your turn once. The "-1" square:

    you don't have any yet, nothing happens. The "+1" square: if you stop on this square, you gain a
    passenger. If you already have 4 and your car is full: nothing happens. The "shortcut" square:
